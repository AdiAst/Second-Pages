The program prepares and delivers hot, nutritious meals to qualified recipients living at home. As part of a team project, I contributed to the development of Merry Meals by working on the back-end implementation that connects the program's database to the front-end interface. Specifically, I was responsible for ensuring that the data was properly formatted and securely transmitted between the back-end and front-end components of the program. By working on this project, I gained experience in both front-end and back-end development, as well as contributing to a meaningful cause that helps improve the lives of others.",
