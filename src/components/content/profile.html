                            I am currently pursuing a course at Lithan Academy where I am acquiring comprehensive knowledge of various web development technologies. The course has given me a deep understanding of technologies such as jQuery, Spring, Liferay, and many more. Additionally, to solidify my understanding of each module, we are required to develop a website related to the topic covered in the module. This hands-on experience has helped me to hone my web development skills and gain practical knowledge in the field.
